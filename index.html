        <strong>1926</strong> - family relocated to Milwaukee, and shortly thereafter to Lansing, Michigan. There, the family was frequently harassed by the Black Legion, a white racist group Earl accused of burning their family home in 1929.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1931</strong> - father died in what has been officially ruled a streetcar accident, though his mother Louise believed Earl had been murdered by the Black Legion. Rumors that white racists were responsible for his father's death were widely circulated and were very disturbing to Malcolm X as a child

      <li>
        <strong>1941</strong> - left high school before graduating eventhough he excelled in junior high school but dropped out of high school after a white teacher told him that practicing law, his aspiration at the time, was "no realistic goal for a nigger".
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1943</strong> - he moved to New York City's Harlem neighborhood, where he found employment on the New Haven Railroad and engaged in drug dealing, gambling, racketeering, robbery, and pimping and befriended John Elroy Sanford, a fellow dishwasher at Jimmy's Chicken Shack in Harlem.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1946</strong> - Was arrested while picking up a stolen watch he had left at a shop for repairs, and in February began serving an eight-to-ten-year sentence at Charlestown State Prison for larceny and breaking and entering
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1953</strong> - was named assistant minister of the Nation's Temple Number One in Detroit.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1953</strong> - FBI began surveillance of him, turning its attention from Malcolm X's possible communist associations to his rapid ascent in the Nation of Islam.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1959</strong> -  featured in a 1959 New York City television broadcast about the Nation of Islam, The Hate That Hate Produced.

      <li>
        <strong>1964</strong> - fullfills the pilgrimage to Mecca which obligatory for every Muslim who is able to do so
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1964</strong> - took part in a debate at the Oxford Union Society. The motion was taken from a statement made earlier that year by U.S. presidential candidate Barry Goldwater: "Extremism in the Defense of Liberty is No Vice; Moderation in the Pursuit of Justice is No Virtue". Malcolm X argued for the affirmative, and interest in the debate was so high that it was televised nationally by the BBC
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1965</strong> - states the interviewer atGordon Parks that the Nation of Islam was actively trying to kill him.
